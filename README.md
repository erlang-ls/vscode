## Building the Extension

The following instructions are useful to build your own language server extension package:

You will have to have `nodejs` installed and have the repository cloned already.

Fetch the submodules of the extension:

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

Checkout a commit from the Erlang LS repository.

```bash
cd erlang_ls
git checkout $YOUR_ERLANG_LS_VERSION
cd ..
```

Download JavaScript dependencies in the main directory. This will create a
`erlang-ls-*.vsix` file.

```bash
npm install
npm run vscode:prepublish
```


1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. View menu / Command Palette
3. Use the command "Developer: Install Extension From Location"
4. Open the directory of your freshly created `.vsix` file.
